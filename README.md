# Example of online Reggression model using python and sklearn

Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most robust machine learning library in Python. It uses a Python consistency interface to provide a set of efficient tools for statistical modeling and machine learning, like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib are the foundations of this package, primarily written in Python.
